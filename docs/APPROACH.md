# Building a Spaced Repetition App in the Open

## What I'm building

A spaced repetition app with [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core and React that will replace my daily use of Anki for knowledge cultivation.

## Why this matters

A place to hone my skills as a software engineer outside of the existing frameworks and coding conventions I rely on in my day job as a full-stack .NET developer.

An opportunity to try public development after years of private study. Building in the open instead of building in isolation.

A reason to dust off my React knowledge and learn based on real needs instead of a course outline.

## Approach

Seven phases. Not waterfall but rather an initial roadmap that will adapt. As I hit each destination, I'll get more information on tweaks I need to make to my overall approach.

GitHub as narrative, not just storage. Commit messages that explain architectural decisions.

## Roadmap

1. Repository setup, commit conventions, etc.
2. Define core MVP through use cases, create criteria for success
3. Auth, hosting, CI/CD foundation
4. Implement MVP, usable for daily study to gather real usage data
5. Evaluate and re-scope based on firsthand experience
6. Design sprint in Figma
7. Polish and advanced features
8. Content and optional monetization

## Philosophy

No plan survives first contact with the enemy. Build a development roadmap, but adapt as you learn. Create testable specifications, but treat them as a rough draft, to trim and augment as appropriate.

TDD as design process and living documentation. Sketch out initial specifications through test-driving, gain more understanding, cut and refine existing tests, create new ones, and so on...

Infrastructure before features. Front-load decisions to avoid scope creep.

A team of one, acting as many. Clear boundaries between roles. For example when I’m using a Figma mock-up as the developer, I do not make tweaks. If changes are needed I “meet” with the “designer” at a later time. Crossing roles mid-work just creates a mess.

## What's Next

Following and updating this roadmap and its philosophies. Sharing the process.
